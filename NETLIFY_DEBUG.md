# 🐛 Netlify "Page Not Found" Debug Steps

## What You Should Do Right Now:

### 1. Open Browser Developer Tools
1. **Go to your Netlify site URL**
2. **Press F12** (or right-click → Inspect)
3. **Go to Console tab**
4. **Refresh the page**

### 2. Check What You See:

**Option A: Nothing loads (blank page)**
- Console shows errors?
- Network tab shows failed requests?
- **Issue**: Build or JavaScript error

**Option B: Netlify's own "Page not found" error**  
- Plain text "Page not found" from Netlify
- **Issue**: Routing problem, _redirects not working

**Option C: React app loads but shows "page not found" inside the app**
- You see the TradeLoop interface but with error
- **Issue**: API connection problem

### 3. Console Debug Info
You should see these logs:
```
🚀 TradeLoop App Loading...
📍 Environment: production  
🌐 API URL: https://tradeloop-api.onrender.com
🌐 API Base URL: https://tradeloop-api.onrender.com
```

### 4. Network Tab Check
- Go to **Network tab** in dev tools
- **Refresh page**
- Look for **failed requests** (red entries)
- Check if API calls to `tradeloop-api.onrender.com` are failing

## Quick Fixes Based on What You Find:

### If Build Failed:
- Check Netlify build logs  
- Environment variable `VITE_API_URL` not set

### If _redirects Not Working:
- Go to Netlify site settings
- Deploy settings → manually add redirect rule: `/* /index.html 200`

### If API Failing:
- Test backend: https://tradeloop-api.onrender.com/health
- Check CORS settings

## Environment Variable Check:
In Netlify dashboard:
1. **Site settings** → **Environment variables**
2. **Add**: `VITE_API_URL` = `https://tradeloop-api.onrender.com`
3. **Redeploy** site
